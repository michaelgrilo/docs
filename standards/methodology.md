# Define-Test-Implement (DTI) Design Philosophy for AI-Assisted Development

## Introduction

**Define-Test-Implement (DTI)** is a structured workflow that guides developers—especially AI-assisted beginners—from idea to working code in three clear phases:

1. **Define** ✅ – write down exactly what you need to build
2. **Test** 🧪 – write automated tests from your definition checklist
3. **Implement** ⚙️ – write the minimum code needed to make your tests pass

By separating concerns this way, DTI lowers cognitive load, keeps AI tools on track, and yields modular, maintainable software.

## The DTI Workflow

### Phase 1 – Define ✅

*Write down exactly what your code needs to do.*

- Write a simple description of what the code should do, a checklist of what success looks like, or rough examples of how the code might be used.
- List what goes into the code (inputs), what should come out (outputs), what must always be true (rules), and any unusual situations to handle (edge-cases).
- Provide this definition to your AI assistant so it has a clear blueprint.

### Phase 2 – Test 🧪

*Write automated tests from the checklist you defined.*

- Turn each item from your checklist into a specific test
- Write tests that check both normal usage and edge cases
- Use these tests to keep AI-generated code on track and catch mistakes early

### Phase 3 – Implement ⚙️

*Write code until your tests pass.*

- Make the smallest change needed to pass the next failing test
- Ask your AI assistant to help write basic code structure
- Check that AI suggestions pass your tests before moving on
- Clean up the code only after all tests pass

## Benefits and Advantages

| Benefit | How DTI Enables It |
|:--------|-------------------|
| **Reduce mental load** | Each phase isolates a single mental task. |
| **Guide AI assistance** | Definitions + tests = explicit, machine-readable guidance. |
| **Catch errors early** | Tests surface problems in AI output immediately. |
| **Verify AI output** | Tests enforce correctness while AI speeds development. |
| **Enforce modularity** | Tests create clear boundaries between components. |
| **Track changes safely** | Tests serve as living documentation and catch regressions. |
| **Enable evolution** | Clear definitions and tests guide safe codebase changes. |

## Methodology Comparisons

| Methodology | Similarities to DTI | Key Differences | When to Choose |
|:-----------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Test-Driven Development** | Writes tests first; iterative loop | Classical TDD skips explicit *Define* step; DTI formalizes design upfront. | Choose when you have clear requirements but want rigorous testing. |
| **Design by Contract** | Specifies behavior before code | DbC uses formal pre/postconditions; DTI uses human-readable definitions + tests. | Choose when you need mathematical precision in interfaces. |
| **Interface-Driven Dev.** | Starts with interface sketches | IDD focuses on APIs; DTI scales from functions to systems with mandatory tests. | Choose when building libraries or public APIs. |

## Getting Started

### Initial Steps

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with a simple function or component
   - Practice the DTI cycle on manageable tasks

2. **Use Templates**
   - Create definition templates for common tasks
   - Maintain a test checklist

3. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Review and improve your definitions
   - Build a library of successful patterns

## Conclusion

DTI blends the best parts of design-first thinking and test-first rigor, giving AI-assisted beginners a repeatable recipe for quality code:

> **Define → Test → Implement → Repeat**

Adopt this loop and you'll stay in control of your project while letting AI handle the busywork—resulting in software that is clear, correct, and easy to grow.
