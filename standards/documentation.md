# Documentation Standards

## Code Documentation
- [ ] Use clear, concise comments
- [ ] Document public APIs comprehensively
- [ ] Include usage examples
- [ ] Keep documentation close to code

## Markdown Documentation
- [ ] Use consistent heading hierarchy
- [ ] Include table of contents for files over 100 lines
- [ ] Keep line length under 120 characters
- [ ] Use proper markdown formatting
- [ ] Include links to related documentation

## Best Practices
- Assume your reader is a capable developer who is completely new to the project
- Document not just what the code does, but why decisions were made
- Provide concrete examples that can be copy-pasted and run immediately

## Review Process
- Documentation changes require peer review
- Technical accuracy verification required
- Grammar and style consistency check
- Broken link verification
- Example code must be tested
- Changes must be reflected in changelog
