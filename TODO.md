# TODO List

## Current Status
- ✅ Created initial architecture documentation
- ✅ Defined development flow and implementation guidelines
- ✅ Established testing strategy
- ✅ Outlined module structure

## Next Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize project with basic directory structure
- [ ] Set up dependency management
- [ ] Configure initial CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up linting and code formatting tools
- [ ] Create initial README.md with setup instructions

### 2. Core Implementation
- [ ] Define core data structures and interfaces
- [ ] Create initial test suites for core components
- [ ] Implement data layer foundations
- [ ] Set up database connections and models
- [ ] Implement basic service layer

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up unit testing framework
- [ ] Configure integration testing environment
- [ ] Set up E2E testing tools
- [ ] Create test data generators
- [ ] Implement CI test automation

### 4. API Development
- [ ] Define API endpoints and contracts
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Implement basic controllers
- [ ] Set up middleware infrastructure
- [ ] Implement input validation

### 5. Security Implementation
- [ ] Set up authentication system
- [ ] Implement authorization rules
- [ ] Configure security middleware
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Implement input sanitization

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Write development guides
- [ ] Document setup procedures
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Document testing procedures

### 7. Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Set up logging infrastructure
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Create benchmark suite
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Implement health checks

### 8. Deployment
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Configure production environment
- [ ] Document deployment procedures
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

## Priority Items
1. Project initialization and basic setup
2. Core data structure implementation
3. Basic test infrastructure
4. Initial API endpoints
5. Security fundamentals

## Notes
- All new features should follow TDD approach outlined in architecture.md
- Each component requires full test coverage before moving to production
- Documentation should be updated alongside code changes
- Security considerations should be addressed at each step
- Performance benchmarks should be established early

## Questions to Address
- [ ] Specific database technology selection
- [ ] Authentication strategy
- [ ] Caching implementation details
- [ ] Monitoring tool selection
- [ ] Production hosting environment

## Future Considerations
- Scalability requirements
- Backup and disaster recovery
- International support
- Mobile API considerations
- Analytics integration

*Remember: Follow the implementation guidelines in architecture.md for all new development.*
